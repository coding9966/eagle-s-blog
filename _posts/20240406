### **Comparison of Classic Bluetooth (BR/EDR) vs. Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) in Terms of Speed:**

When comparing **Classic Bluetooth (BR/EDR)** and **Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)** in terms of speed, it’s important to understand their design and use cases. Here's a breakdown:

---

### **1. Classic Bluetooth (BR/EDR)**

* **Speed**:

  * **Basic Rate (BR)**: Up to **721 Kbps**
  * **Enhanced Data Rate (EDR)**: Up to **3 Mbps**
  * **High Speed (HS)**: Up to **24 Mbps** (using Wi-Fi for large data transfers)

* **Typical Applications**:

  * **Audio Streaming** (e.g., wireless headsets, speakers)
  * **File Transfers**
  * **Peripheral Connections** (e.g., keyboards, mice)

* **Strengths**:

  * **Higher data transfer rates** than BLE (especially at 3 Mbps and up to 24 Mbps with Bluetooth 3.0).
  * **More suitable for continuous or higher-bandwidth applications** like streaming audio or large file transfers.

* **Weaknesses**:

  * **Higher power consumption** compared to Bluetooth LE, which can reduce battery life in small devices like wearables.
  * Less optimized for low-power applications.

### **2. Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)**

* **Speed**:

  * **Bluetooth 4.x** (LE) Speed: **1 Mbps**
  * **Bluetooth 5.x** (LE) Speed: **2 Mbps** (with **LE 2M PHY**)
  * **Bluetooth 5.2** (LE) Speed: **2 Mbps** (LE Audio supported)

* **Typical Applications**:

  * **IoT devices** (e.g., smart sensors, fitness trackers)
  * **Low-power, short-range communications** (e.g., smartwatches, smart home devices)
  * **Audio Streaming** (e.g., LE Audio, hearing aids)

* **Strengths**:

  * **Low power consumption** designed for battery-operated devices like wearables, sensors, and IoT applications.
  * Optimized for short bursts of data transmission rather than continuous streaming.
  * Great for devices that don’t require high bandwidth, such as health devices, smart home gadgets, and low-power peripherals.

* **Weaknesses**:

  * **Lower data transfer rates** than Classic Bluetooth, making it unsuitable for high-bandwidth applications like audio streaming at high quality.
  * **Limited range** compared to Classic Bluetooth, although it can still offer decent performance with the appropriate PHY configuration.

### **Speed Comparison (Summary)**:

| Feature               | **Classic Bluetooth (BR/EDR)**                                      | **Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)**                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Maximum Speed**     | **3 Mbps** (EDR), up to **24 Mbps** (Bluetooth 3.0 with Wi-Fi)      | **1 Mbps** (Bluetooth 4.x), **2 Mbps** (Bluetooth 5.x)              |
| **Ideal Use Cases**   | High-bandwidth applications (e.g., audio streaming, file transfers) | Low-power, short-range applications (e.g., sensors, wearables, IoT) |
| **Power Consumption** | Higher power consumption, especially at higher speeds               | Optimized for very low power consumption                            |

### **Key Differences**:

* **Speed**: Classic Bluetooth (BR/EDR) is significantly faster, with **3 Mbps** being the standard and **up to 24 Mbps** in certain cases. Bluetooth LE, however, is limited to **1 Mbps** (Bluetooth 4.x) or **2 Mbps** (Bluetooth 5.x), making it less suitable for applications requiring large amounts of data transmission like HD audio or video.
* **Power Consumption**: Bluetooth LE is designed for **low-power consumption**, suitable for battery-powered devices. Classic Bluetooth uses more power, which is why it’s used for devices where a constant connection and higher bandwidth are necessary, like audio streaming.

### **Which One to Choose?**

* If you need **higher data transfer speeds** and are working on devices like **wireless speakers** or need to **stream audio**, **Classic Bluetooth** (BR/EDR) is the better choice.
* For devices like **fitness trackers**, **smartwatches**, **IoT sensors**, and other **low-power devices**, **Bluetooth LE** (especially Bluetooth 5.x with 2 Mbps) would be the preferred option, despite the lower data rate.
